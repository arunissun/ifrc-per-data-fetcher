Il existe une loi sur l\u2019embl\u00e8me, d'apr\u00e8s le plan strat\u00e9gique de la SN. \nLa Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale du CRCo en tant qu\u2019auxiliaire des pouvoirs publics dans le domaine de l\u2019humanitaire intervient r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement et de fa\u00e7on tr\u00e8s active dans les situations d\u2019urgence aux c\u00f4t\u00e9s de l\u2019Etat comorien, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 son r\u00f4le bien d\u00e9fini dans le Plan National de Pr\u00e9paration et de R\u00e9ponse aux Urgences de l\u2019Union des Comores.

Mais ceci ne se refl\u00e8te pas dans un mandat officiel. D\u00e8s la cr\u00e9ation de la plateforme PIROI en 2000, le CRCo est devenu membre \u00e0 part enti\u00e8re. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu par le CICR en septembre 2005.\nParfois le r\u00f4le d'auxiliaire aux pouvoirs publics sur CRCo est mal compris par les autorit\u00e9s surtout sur la GRC. Le CRCo est m\u00eame parfois vu comme un concurrent potentiel. La connaissance du r\u00f4le du CRCo se perd au niveau des autorit\u00e9s car le personnel change souvent.\nIl n\u2019existe pas de mandat officiel avec une valeur juridique qui d\u00e9crit clairement le r\u00f4le du CRCo au niveau communautaire et en urgence.\nUne mission avec la FICR fin octobre 2024 a permis d'\u00e9laborer une \u00e9bauche de convention de partenariat avec la DGSC. La signature est pr\u00e9vue la semaine du 11/11/24 en pr\u00e9sence de la FICR. La convention aura besoin d'\u00eatre diffus\u00e9e une fois sign\u00e9e.\nLe plan strat\u00e9gique est r\u00e9gi par les valeurs et Principes du Mouvement international de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge. Des strat\u00e9gies existent, la volont\u00e9 est l\u00e0 de diffuser jusqu'aux volontaires, mais en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 il n\u2019y a pas de diffusion et le changement des ressources humaines (volontaires et staff) fait que la compr\u00e9hension est limit\u00e9e.\nPas de responsable au sein de la SN qui fait la promotion du DIH aupr\u00e8s des autorit\u00e9s publiques. Mais la promotion des Principes et Valeurs Humanitaires se fait lorsqu'il y a de grands \u00e9v\u00e8nements. \nPour les \u00e9pid\u00e9mies, la strat\u00e9gie CRCo 2021-2025 inclut un axe strat\u00e9gique intitul\u00e9 \"Am\u00e9lioration de la sant\u00e9 des vuln\u00e9rables\" dans lequel s'inscrit l'objectif de r\u00e9duire l'impact des maladies et des urgences de sant\u00e9 publique, notamment le nombre de morts et de cas de maladies.\nCe r\u00f4le de la SN est connu des partenaires mais aucun cadre juridique ne l'indique. C'est m\u00eame une demande du DG sant\u00e9 au niveau de l'Etat qui veut inclure le CRCo officiellement.\nLa SN n'a pas un engagement \u00e0 long terme pour une politique environnementale des programmes et interventions.",

Il n\u2019y a pas de parcours d'apprentissage dont les volontaires prennent connaissance d\u00e8s leur admission au CRCo. Pas de formation de base non plus sur le Mouvement et les attentes. En urgence, les volontaires spontan\u00e9s ne sont pas inform\u00e9s sur un minimum de notions (Principes fondamentaux, r\u00e9actions inacceptables, etc.) et donc des incidents peuvent survenir et sont un risque sur l\u2019image du CRCo. Pas d'analyse sp\u00e9cifique sur l\u2019acc\u00e8s s\u00e9curis\u00e9. Pas de formations sur la protection, l'abus et le genre.

Les mesures de protection (m\u00eame en cas d\u2019\u00e9pid\u00e9mies) se limitent aux EPI. Il n\u2019existe pas de point focal pour suivre cela non plus.\nDes termes de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence sont pr\u00e9par\u00e9s pour la mobilisation des volontaires durant les r\u00e9ponses d\u2019urgence car c\u2019est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement une exigence reli\u00e9e aux fonds. Il n\u2019existe pas de signe d\u2019institutionnalisation de cette proc\u00e9dure au cas o\u00f9 la SN agit hors lignes budg\u00e9taires. \nLes volontaires sont couverts par l\u2019assurance de la FICR (qui ne couvrent pas les \u00e9pid\u00e9mies). Le code de conduite n\u2019est pas connu ni sign\u00e9 par le staff et les volontaires. Les d\u00e9penses des volontaires ne sont rembours\u00e9es que s\u2019il y a un DREF qui se d\u00e9clenche.\nIl n\u2019existe pas de base de donn\u00e9es effective, digitale, pour g\u00e9rer les volontaires sur base de leurs formations. Toutefois, des annexes existent dans le plan de contingence \u00ab Inondations \u00bb et notamment une cartographie des BDRT dans les 3 branches.\nDans les branches, les bases de donn\u00e9es sont faites en forme de registre sur papier et de listes reli\u00e9es aux formations. M\u00eame si les listes se capitalisent aussi sur Excel, les donn\u00e9es utilis\u00e9es en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 sont sur papier.

Un nouveau point focal a \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 en vue de suivre le renseignement et l\u2019activation de l\u2019usage des bases de donn\u00e9es.\nPour les interventions, la SN appelle tous les volontaires disponibles \u00e0 se mobiliser. Ceci permet d\u2019avoir des capacit\u00e9s multisectorielles mais vu que de nombreux volontaires sont motiv\u00e9s, leur gestion devient difficile et des frustrations se cr\u00e9ent lorsque les coordinateurs demandent \u00e0 quelques volontaires de quitter les lieux (exemple 300 sur place alors que le besoin est de 20 volontaires).\nDes proc\u00e9dures existent pour activer, d\u00e9ployer et g\u00e9rer les BDRT et NDRT mais pas de proc\u00e9dures ni de fonds propres permettant d\u2019augmenter (recrutement, r\u00e9tention) ou de diminuer le personnel pendant les urgences.\nPas de strat\u00e9gie formelle de rotation et de r\u00e9tention du personnel durant les interventions. Des notions sont inclues dans le r\u00e8glement int\u00e9rieur mais ne sont pas sp\u00e9cifiques aux urgences.\nPas de formations sur les soins auto-administr\u00e9s, la violence et le harc\u00e8lement au travail et le soutien psychosocial pendant et apr\u00e8s les urgences et les crises. La formation sur la pr\u00e9vention et le contr\u00f4le des \u00e9pid\u00e9mies se fait uniquement au niveau des volontaires mobilisables (\u00e9quipes d'intervention BDRT et NDRT).",

Le point focal DREF est Siradji (PF projet PIROI). Les responsables des secteurs travaillent sur leurs propres parties.\nLes accords cadre avec des donateurs se limite \u00e0 l\u2019accord avec la PIROI : l'accord de Saint Denis pour la sortie de Stocks d'urgence, la pr\u00e9paration et la mobilisation des ERU. La SN ne mobilise pas de ressources pour ses activit\u00e9s de pr\u00e9paration (aupr\u00e8s du secteur priv\u00e9 ou autre).
